1. Search for drivers by name or zone.
2. Filter bookings by selecting a start and end date.
3. View the list of highest-paid drivers based on earnings.
4. Analyse driver acceptance performance to determine service preferences.
5. Provide a dashboard with insights into revenue, bookings, and acceptance rates.

Key Functionalities
1. Search for drivers (by name or location zone).
2. Filter bookings (by date range).
3. View highest-paid drivers.
4. Analyse driver acceptance rate.
